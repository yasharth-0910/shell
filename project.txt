Project Title: Custom Bash Shell Environment

Overview:
This project implements a custom shell environment with 20+ Bash scripts for system administration, networking, and interactive computing. The shell demonstrates core OS concepts including process management, file systems, and network programming.

Technology Stack:
- Language: Bash 4.0+
- Tools: netcat, curl, coreutils
- Platform: Linux/Unix systems

Script Components:

1. System Administration (Priority: High)
   - DirectorySize.sh: Reports directory size using du command
   - Test-File.sh: Checks file/directory status and permissions
   - Server-Health.sh: Monitors uptime, load, memory usage
   - CPU.sh: Alerts when CPU usage exceeds threshold
   - Disk-Space.sh: Monitors disk space availability
   - CollectNetworkInfo.sh: Gathers network configuration data
   - RemoteBackup.sh: Backs up files to remote server via SCP
   - HardwareInfo.sh: Displays system hardware information
   - Get-Temperature.sh: Reads CPU temperature from sensors

2. Network Services
   - tiny-http.sh: Implements a minimal HTTP server using Bash and netcat. Handles basic GET requests and serves static content.

3. Mathematical Operations
   - Addition.sh, Subtraction.sh, Multiplication.sh, Division.sh: Basic arithmetic operations with input validation
   - Simplecalc.sh: Interactive calculator combining all operations

4. Interactive Utilities
   - Hello.sh: Basic I/O demonstration
   - Process.sh: Command chaining example
   - Interactive.sh: Menu-driven interface
   - pomodoro.sh: Productivity timer (25-min work intervals)

5. Miscellaneous
   - Affect.sh: Animated spinner for long processes
   - Colorful.sh: Terminal color demonstration
   - weather.sh: Fetches weather using geolocation
   - RedditTop.sh: Displays top 5 subreddit posts
   - MusicBeep.sh: Plays melodies using terminal beep

Implementation Details:
Core Features:
- Command parsing with tokenization
- Built-in command execution (cd, exit, help)
- External script integration
- Error handling and input validation
- Signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM)

Key Technical Implementations:
- File Operations: Using /proc and /sys filesystems
- Network Programming: Socket handling with netcat
- API Integration: JSON parsing with jq
- Process Management: Fork-exec model

Scripts Under Consideration:
Some scripts may be excluded from the final implementation:
- MusicBeep.sh: Requires specific hardware support
- Affect.sh: Limited practical utility
- Colorful.sh: Mainly for demonstration

Working Methodology:
1. User inputs command in custom shell
2. Shell parses and identifies script/command
3. Appropriate script is executed with parameters
4. Output is displayed in formatted manner
5. Shell returns to prompt for next command

Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrates shell programming concepts and system administration capabilities. The modular design allows easy extension while maintaining code clarity. The implementation serves as both a practical tool and educational resource for understanding Unix/Linux systems.

Key Achievements:
- Functional shell with 20+ utility scripts
- Clean, modular architecture
- Practical system administration tools
- Educational value for OS concepts
